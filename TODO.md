# Pocket Metropolis to-do

`[ ]` to do · `[x]` done · **Decision** marks a choice to settle before building.

## Done

- [x] Isometric pastel city on canvas with build tools, bounce and dust effects, day/night cycle
- [x] Residents move into the most desirable homes; cars and pedestrians
- [x] Versioned saves with migrations; Random Town; deployed on Vercel
- [x] 32×32 map, jobs (shop, office), services (school, clinic), traffic, Inspect tool, map views, speed controls
- [x] Life Story, first version (see section 1)
- [x] Phone layout: Life and a controls sheet up top instead of a column of side buttons; compact landscape layout
- [x] Phase 1 polish: sound effects and ambience, drag to build, undo and redo, buildings that grow and vary, seasons and weather
- [x] Phase 3 Life Story: activities, buying a home, real neighbours, 34 new events, the character walking on the map, achievements and ribbons
- [x] Phase 2 goals: milestones (Hamlet → Metropolis) with unlocks and a celebration, playground and sports field, resident thoughts with Show me, +/− desirability feedback when placing

## 1. Life Story: live one resident's life

You create a main character who moves into your city. Every so often a text event pops up, like a message: *"Your neighbour invites you to the park on Saturday."* You pick one of two to four choices, and each choice leads to its own outcome that changes your character's stats and story (in the spirit of BitLife). The city you build shapes that life: the schools, clinics, jobs and parks you place decide which events and careers are possible.

### 1a. Create a character
- [x] Creation screen: name, pronouns, look (skin tone, hair, outfit colour)
- [x] Two starting traits that tilt outcomes (Curious, Outgoing, Thrifty, Sporty, Creative, Calm…)
- [x] **Decided:** born as a baby into a family living in one of the city's homes
- [x] A pin marks the character's home (and later their workplace) on the map
- [x] Show the character as a highlighted walker on the map
- [x] Save the character with the city (stored in `city.systems.life`, so no save migration was needed)

### 1b. Stats, age and life stages
- [x] Stats from 0 to 100: Happiness, Health, Smarts, Looks; plus Money
- [x] **Decided:** both. A year passes per in-game day in the background, and Age up skips ahead; life time stops while an event waits
- [x] Life stages: child, teen, young adult, adult, senior; a life ends, and you can continue as your child
- [x] Life log: a scrollable timeline of every event and choice ("Age 17: You aced your exams.")

### 1c. Event engine
- [x] Data-driven events: conditions (age, stage, stats, traits, flags, city facts), text with `{name}` placeholders, choices, weighted outcomes, stat changes, follow-up events
- [x] Bulldozing the character's home or workplace changes their life straight away
- [x] Scheduler with cooldowns so events don't repeat too soon; nothing fires while paused
- [x] Message-style pop-up card that works on phones, with an outcome card showing stat changes
- [x] Event chains through flags (dating leads to moving in, proposing and a baby)
- [x] Unit tests for condition matching, outcome rolls and chains

### 1d. Link the life to the city
- [x] School nearby: school events and faster Smarts growth; no school means fewer options
- [x] Clinic nearby: illnesses are milder and recovery faster
- [x] Careers come from real workplaces (shop, office, school, clinic); applications fail when there are no openings
- [x] Traffic on your commute adds stress events; parks and trees near home add calm ones
- [x] Your character walks their real commute (driving is still to do)
- [x] Moving house: choose a new home among vacancies, with desirability shown

### 1e. First content pack
- [x] 44 events across babyhood, childhood, teen years, adulthood and old age
- [x] Relationships: family, friends and a partner, each with closeness from 0 to 100
- [x] Careers with promotions: shop assistant → shop manager, office junior → director, teacher, nurse → doctor
- [x] Money: yearly savings from wages, purchases, rent

### 1f. Polish
- [x] Badge on a Life button when an event is waiting
- [ ] Settings: event frequency, pause the city while an event is open
- [x] More events: siblings, neighbours from real nearby homes, city milestones, weather and seasons, playground and sports field (78 events in all)
- [ ] Pets with names you choose; more senior and teen events
- [x] Choose with the keyboard; respects reduced motion

## 2. Next up (from the GitHub research plan)

- [x] Milestones and unlocks: Hamlet → Village → Town → City → Metropolis, unlocking buildings with a small celebration
- [x] Resident thoughts and advisor hints that point to real places on the map
- [x] Floating "+8" desirability feedback when placing parks and services
- [x] **Decided:** no coins for now; milestones are the goal
- [ ] More milestone unlocks as new buildings arrive (community centre, bus stop, police and fire)
- [x] Life Story activities you can do any time (study, exercise, date, visit, shop, volunteer, overtime, babysit)
- [x] Buy a real home in the city, priced by desirability
- [x] More Life Story events, achievements (kept across lives) and life ribbons
- [ ] **Decision:** move events to inkjs once there are a few hundred (plain JS data is fine for now)
- [ ] Share a city as a link (lz-string)

## 3. Ideas from IsoCity

From [isometric-city](https://github.com/uxcaleb/isometric-city) (originally amilich/isometric-city) (MIT). Ideas to adapt, not code to copy.

- [ ] Minimap for the bigger map; tap to jump there
- [x] Advisors: short hints such as "The roads are jammed at rush hour" (resident thoughts)
- [ ] Roads over water drawn as bridges
- [ ] Buses and bus stops; trains later
- [ ] More building variety: small and medium houses, apartments, a mall
- [ ] Buildings bigger than one tile (2×2), which needs multi-tile footprints in the state
- [x] Recreation: playground and sports field; the entertainment factor is on
- [ ] Community centre
- [ ] Police and fire stations with gentle incidents (a small fire, a lost cat), turning on the safety factor
- [ ] City name generator and several saved cities
- [ ] Statistics panel with history sparklines

## 4. Deploy and tooling
- [ ] Move the code to `andrerlaster-lgtm/Metropolis` and link it to Vercel so every push redeploys (until then each deploy is started by hand)
- [ ] Test pinch and long-press on a real phone
- [ ] Run `npm test` on every pull request with GitHub Actions
