// Notable people: like great people in Civilization, a famous resident is born in (or moves to) the
// town when its buildings have earned enough "inspiration" of one kind. Schools inspire scientists,
// clinics doctors, businesses merchants, factories engineers, parks and cafés artists, sports fields
// athletes, and a growing population town planners. Each notable gives the whole town a bonus.
//
// Saved in city.systems.notables = { points: { type: n }, people: [...], nextId }.
// Data-driven: add a type to NOTABLE_TYPES with its sources, its bonus text and its effect.
