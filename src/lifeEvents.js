// Life Story events. Each event: when it can happen (stages, ages, `when`), its text, and choices.
// A choice has weighted outcomes; an outcome has text and effects (stats, money, closeness, flags),
// plus optional `do(ctx)` for changes like a new friend or job, and `next` to chain another event.
// Text placeholders: {name} {fullname} {their} {them} {mother} {father} {friend} {partner} {child}
// {job} {workplace}. Write sentences with {name} as the subject so every pronoun reads naturally.
